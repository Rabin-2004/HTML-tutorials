    <!-- HTML use features to use quotations be it block or inline quotations-->

    <!-- If a section of block level contents be it paragraph, a list, multiple paragraphs etc. are quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside <blockquote> and include a URL pointing to the source using cite attribute-->
        <p> Here is a blockqote:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis">
            <p>
                Atlantis is a fictional island mentioned in Plato's works <em> Timaeus </em> and <em> Critias </em>as part of an allegory on the hubris of nations.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

    <!-- If you want to include an inline quote e.g. a small line inside a paragraph you use an inline quotes. This works in same way as in block quote the difference is that we use a <q> tag for inline quotes and it encloses the quotes in a ""-->
        <p> Here is an inline quote </p>
        <p>
            <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis"> Atlantis </q> is an mythical city said to exist in ancient greece
        </p>

    <!-- cite element is different from the cite attribute of blockquote and inlinequote. Screen readers do absolutely nothing with the text inside cite attribute. The <cite> element is meant to contain the title of resource being quoted. Citations are in italic font style by default -->

    <!-- The <abbr> tag is used to wrap around abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. If providing the expansion in addition to the abbreviation makes little sense, and the abbreviation or acronym is a fairly shortened term, provide the full expansion of the term as the value of title attribute. This tag if provided with a title attribute provides a dotted underline for enclosing text.-->

<!-- HTML also provides <time> to markup times and dates in machine readable format. there are many different ways that humans write down dates. But these different forms cannot be easily recognized by computers â€” what if you wanted to automatically grab the dates of all events in a page and insert them into a calendar? The <time> element allows you to attach an unambiguous, machine-readable time/date for this purpose.-->
 <time datetime="2024-12-24">24 December 2024</time>
 <!-- The above format is the simple format. There are many different formats to write this same date as follows:-->

 <pre>
    <!--Standard simple date-->
    <time datetime="2024-12-24">24 December 2024</time>

    <!--Just year and month-->
    <time datetime="2024-12">Dec 2024</time>
