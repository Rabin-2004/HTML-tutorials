# Media assets and licensing
- Images (and other media asset types) you find on the web are released under various license types. Before you use an image on a site you are building, ensure you own it, have permission to use it, or comply with the owner's licensing conditions.

## Understanding license types
- Following are some common categories of licenses you are likely to find on the web:

### All rights reserved
Creators of original work such as songs, books, or software often release their work under closed copyright protection. This means that, by default, they (or their publisher) have exclusive rights to use (for example, display or distribute) their work. Authors are not required to include a copyright notice or license terms with their work. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is created in a tangible medium. So if you find an image online and there are no copyright notices or license terms, the safest course is to assume it is protected by copyright with all rights reserved. If you want to use copyrighted images with an all rights reserved license, you need to do one of the following:

- Obtain explicit, written permission from the copyright holder.
- Pay a license fee to use them. This can be a one-time fee for unlimited use ("royalty-free"), or it might be "rights-managed", in which case you might have to pay specific fees per use by time slot, geographic region, industry or media type, etc.
- Limit your uses to those that would be considered fair use or fair dealing in your jurisdiction.

### Permissive
If the image is released under a permissive license, such as MIT, BSD, or a suitable Creative Commons (CC) license, you do not need to pay a license fee or seek permission to use it. Still, there are various licensing conditions you will have to fulfill, which vary by license. or example, you might have to: provide a link to the original source of the image and credit its creator, indicate whether any changes were made to it, share any derivative works created using the image under the same license as the original.

### Public domain/CCO
Work released into the public domain is sometimes referred to as "no rights reserved" â€” no copyright applies to it, and it can be used without permission and without having to fulfill any licensing conditions. Work can end up in the public domain by various means such as expiration of copyright, or specific waiving of rights.
